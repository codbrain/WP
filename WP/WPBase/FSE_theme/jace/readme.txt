== Changelog ==

1.0.7
This update includes major changes to make sure that the theme is
up to date with WordPress 6.2.
The minimum required version was increased to 6.2.
Updates to spacing.
Updates to button styles.
Updates to the custom CSS added by theme.json.
Removed several block CSS files since they were no longer needed.
Added the Schema to theme.json.
Added a new template part for comments, using the new comment blocks.
The following templates were updated to use the new comments template part.
You will see some style improvements for the comments area,
if you reset your templates to the theme default:
- Featured image centered above post title
- Split design with featured image and post title
- Full screen featured image cover block with post title
- Full width featured image above post title
- Page
- Sidebar
- Single
Updated the heading blocks to include the class "wp-block-heading".
Simplified the 404 page
Removed the filter that added the default template, because it is no longer needed,
the editor now lets you choose from premade templates when you create a new template.

WooCommerce:
Updated the product archive, singe product, checkout, cart, and product search 
with the latest WooCommerce product blocks.
Removed the minicart template part because it was incompatible with a recent WooCommerce update.
Removed a JavaScript that unregistered block variations,
because it was incompatible with a recent WooCommerce update.
Changed the default header on the checkout page and cart page,
because WooCommerce does not show the cart menu item on these pages.


1.0.6
Fixes:
A layout issue on the 404 page.
There was a bug with the social sharing pattern, and only the Facebook link worked.
The sharing links now use the home link, not the post link. Unfortunately this is the best I can
do without creating custom blocks (The technical explaination is that patterns are
created on 'init' and do not have access to the global scope where the post link is available).
Design changes:
Removed the animation from the support forum call to action.
Page: Increased spacing below page title.
Removed padding and shadow around the sticky footer on the cart page.
Accessibility: Increased color contrast for captions. This is a temporary solution until captions can be styled through block styles or theme.json.

1.0.5
Bug fix with block pattern slug

1.0.4
Minimum required WordPress version increased to 6.0.
Moved the CSS files into separate folders for the source and the minified files.
Removed the "No space between images" block style since Gutenberg have added support for block spacing to the gallery block.
Added a new cleaner button style for the footer buttons and navigation block.
Removed the circular cover block since it was difficult to make it look good on mobiles.
Added new header and footer parts.
Added multiple new block patterns and renamed the patterns folder to block-patterns.
Added new templates for WooCommerce, a blank template and a template with a sidebar.
Updated the sticky header. There are now options for making the entire header sticky, or only the menu button.
Fixed a bug with the separator block overlapping the sticky header.
Removed jace_enqueue_block_styles() in favor of wp_enqueue_block_style(), used in jace_setup().

1.0.3
Bug fix: Removed border.

1.0.2
Updated the default and responsive heights of the circular cover block.
Moved the CSS for the responsive font sizes to forms-and-buttons.css
so that it is applied to both the editor and front.
Added the default template for template editing.

1.0.1
Corrected some typos.
Corrected the title of the circular cover block pattern.
Simplified the "split header with featured image" block pattern.
Added more block patterns and styles.
Removed an unnecesary folder and moved register-block-styles.php to the inc/ folder.
Replaced a duotone color that was duplicated by mistake.
Reduced the largest font size on smaller screens.
Added serif and monospace system fonts.
Updated screenshot.
